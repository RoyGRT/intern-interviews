      <p> This photo is the sunset I took at Sunset Cliff in San Diego in 2019. At that time, I was very interested in photography and bought a DSLR camera, and this is the first proper photo I took. This is still my favorite picture till now. When I took this picture, the sunlight perfectly divided the sence into two totally opposite tone from the middle and this photo was a huge suprise to me for my first time doing scenery photography.</p>

      <p> Hello! My name is Ruotian Gao and you can call me Roy. I'm currently a senior majoring in Data Science at UCSD. At the same time, with my strong passion in Computer Science, I also spent a great amount of my time studying computer science courses and learnt a decent amount of programming knowledge such as Java and C. Having both sufficient knowledge of data science and computer science, I firmly believe that I can qualify for the software engineering internship. I am eager to improve my coding skills and understand more about the technology industry trends. Meanwhile, I look forward to collaborating with other colleagues in product and UIUX to craft the best product. I would love to challenge myself to be one not only knows how to code, but also knows how to effectively communicate with the stakeholders of the product. I am excited for the opportunity and would love to chat about my previous experiences.
